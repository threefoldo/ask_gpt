      "Yes, I can provide a practical case of using iS-RPM, which is an RPM product from Yisaqi. The task mining feature of iS-RPM can help decision-makers identify which stage of the process to implement RPA robots, enabling more effective expansion of RPA projects and improving process automation benefits. The \"Discovery Robot\" installed on the user's desktop allows enterprises to capture any operation by employees on their desktops and analyze the captured event information, providing bottom-level technical support for discovering and mining automated business processes. iS-RPM breaks through the \"manual\" demand management bottleneck in traditional automation business management activities by automatically identifying high-frequency tasks and giving evaluators a global perspective to prioritize the development of automated processes, continuously outputting automation opportunities from the bottom up. The product also provides ROI analysis, time analysis, and other analysis panels to help analysts conduct in-depth research on tasks and understand the process events. Additionally, iS-RPM supports seamless integration with RPA and can export RPA requirement documents and engineering files, making it easier and faster for RPA developers to generate process steps and nodes. Overall, iS-RPM can help enterprises accelerate the implementation of RPA industry-scale changes, reduce RPA project operation and maintenance costs, and help enterprises start the automation flywheel.\n"
